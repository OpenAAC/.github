# OpenAAC

Open AAC is a Free (Libre) and Open Source project (and app) which aims at
offering an open source alternative to current high tech AACs (Alternative and
Augmentative Communication). At OpenAAC we believe that no one should ever have
to pay in order to communicate with others, which is the reason why we created
OpenAAC.

This project is collaborative, which means that if you've got any suggestions
about any of our products - even if you have no idea how to help in any way -
we're happy to take them and add them to our todo list. Obviously this is an
open source project, thus if you know how to code you can do the usual fork+
pull request, etc... on any of our repos.
